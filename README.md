# Interpretable-SONAR-Image-Classifier
Part of the Project: Under water sonar image classification with XAI LIME: eXplainable AI (XAI) to interpret deep learning models in underwater SONAR image classification. We utilize transfer learning with CNN architectures like VGG16 and ResNet50, and apply LIME, SHAP and Grad-CAM for transparent model explanations.
